ECDSA implementation with JSBN library


brief description:

this is a fairly simple implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography DSA. I have used Tom Wus EC libraris.
The code itself should be fairly self-explainatory. 
There are few things to add to this for performance improvement, which I don't have time to do.
This is part of my master thesis at NTNU.
